## Project: Bizplan â€” Business Planning SaaS Platform

My Responsibilities & Key Features Implemented:

Implemented a drag-and-drop interface to manage and update the status of tasks or meetings, enabling users to visually track progress and streamline planning.

Spreadsheet-like Financial Data Handling:
Utilized Silevis ReactGrid to build a dynamic, spreadsheet-style table for managing financial and user data.
Features included:

Add, remove, and reorder rows and columns

Inline editing and live calculations

Drag-and-drop support for rearranging financial data

WYSIWYG Editor Integration:
Integrated Froala Editor with custom plugins to auto-fit text and enhance document editing for business plans and presentations.

Subscription Management:
Integrated Stripe to handle subscription models, including tiered pricing plans and secure payment flows.

Analytics Dashboards:
Helped create dashboards using Superset for admins and investors to view key insights and metrics.


# Jitsi Event?
When you embed Jitsi Meet into a web application using the Jitsi External API, you can listen to events that occur during a video conference. These are called Jitsi events.

They let you respond to things like:

A user joining or leaving the meeting

Audio/video being muted or unmuted

Screen sharing starting/stopping

The conference ending
