Component Initialization

Components are initialized with props/state.

Render Phase

React calls the component function and generates a virtual DOM tree.

Diffing Phase

Compares the new VDOM with the old VDOM (reconciliation).

Commit Phase

Applies the minimum number of real DOM operations.

Re-rendering

Triggered when state or props change.

# React Interview Questions and Answers (With Examples and Use Cases)

## 1. What is React and why is it popular?

**Answer:** React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications (SPAs).

**Why it's popular:**

* Component-based architecture (View of MVC) ng is(Complete MVC)
* Virtual DOM improves performance
* Strong ecosystem (Redux, React Router, etc.)
* Backed by Facebook

**Example:**

```jsx
function Hello() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}
```

---

## 2. What are the limitations of React?

* JSX adds complexity
* Rapid changes in ecosystem
* SEO limitations in SPAs
* Requires libraries for routing/state management

**Use Case Example:** Needing `react-router-dom` to manage routes.

---

## 3. Key advantages of using React in large-scale apps?

* Reusable components
* Virtual DOM for performance
* Rich developer tools

**Use Case:** Large dashboards where components like buttons, cards, etc., are reused.

---

## 4. Explain Strict Mode in React

**Answer:** Highlights potential problems like unsafe lifecycles or side effects.

**Use Case:**

```jsx
<React.StrictMode>
  <App />
</React.StrictMode>
```

---

## 5. Can React Hooks replace Redux in all scenarios?

**Answer:** No. Hooks work for local and moderately complex state. Redux is better for large-scale apps.

**Use Case:** Using `useContext` and `useReducer` for basic auth logic.

---

## 6. useState() vs useReducer()

**Use Case:** `useReducer` is better for forms or complex states.
One or two state variables with simple updates	✅ useState()
Need a quick and simple component state	✅ useState()
Complex state object with multiple updates or dependent state	✅ useReducer()
Need to reuse state logic or unit test state transitions	✅ useReducer()

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // useState


const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState); // useReducer

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });
  return (
    <>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

---

## 7. How does useEffect() work? Use cases?

**Answer:** Runs side effects after rendering.

**Example:**

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, []);
```

**Use Cases:** Fetching data, subscriptions, DOM updates.

---

## 8. Prevent unnecessary re-renders

* `React.memo` for components
* `useMemo` for expensive values
* `useCallback` for functions

**Example:**

```jsx
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
```

---

## 9. Virtual DOM

**Answer:** React's internal representation of the real DOM. Efficient updates using diffing.

**Use Case:** Updating a single element in a large UI tree.

---

## 10. Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components

```jsx
// Controlled
// A controlled component is one where the form input’s value is controlled by React state.
<input value={value} onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)} />

// Uncontrolled
// An uncontrolled component lets the DOM handle the form input. You use refs to access the value.
<input ref={inputRef} />
```

**Use Case:** Controlled for validation; uncontrolled for quick form use.

---

## 11. Forms and validation

**Answer:** Use controlled inputs or libraries.

**Example with React Hook Form:**

```jsx
const { register, handleSubmit } = useForm();
```

---

## 12. Refs in React

**Answer:** Access DOM or persist values across renders.

**Example:**

```jsx
const inputRef = useRef(null);
<input ref={inputRef} />
```

**Use Case:** Focus input field.

---

## 13. Error boundaries

**Answer:** Catch errors in the render phase.

```jsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    logError(error);
  }
  render() {
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

---

## 14. React Context API

**Answer:** Avoids prop drilling.

**Use Case:**

```jsx
const ThemeContext = React.createContext();
```

---

## 15. useCallback vs useMemo

```jsx
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => doSomething(a, b), [a, b]);
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => compute(a, b), [a, b]);
```

---

## 16. SSR vs CSR

* SSR: SEO-friendly, faster initial load (e.g., Next.js)
* CSR: Better for dynamic apps

---

## 17. Lazy Loading

```jsx
const LazyComp = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComp'));
```

**Use Case:** Load routes/components on demand.

---

## 18. Code Splitting

**Use:** `React.lazy`, `Suspense`

**Example:**

```jsx
<Suspense fallback={<Loader />}>
  <LazyComp />
</Suspense>
```

---

## 19. Global State Management

Use Context, Redux, Zustand, Recoil.

**Use Case:** Auth state, theme settings.

---

## 20. Redux vs Context API (they are prevention of  prop driling )

* Redux: Complex, scalable state logic, global state managment lib
* Context: Lightweight global state, Dependencies injection machenism

---

## 21. Purpose of keys in lists

```jsx
DOM reordering - Optimized, State preservation for Accurate,Performance	faster.
{items.map(item => <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>)}
```

**Why:** Helps React identify item changes.

---

## 22. Fragment vs div

```jsx
<>
  <Child1 />
  <Child2 />
</>
```

Avoids extra divs in DOM.

---

## 23. React Portals

```jsx
ReactDOM.createPortal(<Modal />, document.getElementById('modal-root'));
```

**Use Case:** Modals, tooltips.

---

## 24. useRef vs createRef

* `useRef`: Functional components
* `createRef`: Class components

---

## 25. useLayoutEffect vs useEffect

* `useLayoutEffect`: Runs before paint
* `useEffect`: After paint

---

## 26. Best practices for side effects

* Clean up in `useEffect`
* Use correct dependency arrays

---

## 27. Debouncing and throttling

```jsx
const debouncedFn = debounce(() => doSomething(), 300);
```

**Use Case:** Search inputs, resize listeners.

---

## 28. Component Communication

* Parent to Child: Props
* Child to Parent: Callbacks
* Siblings: Lift state up or Context

---

## 29. Prop Drilling

**Problem:** Passing props through many layers

**Solution:** Context or Redux

---

## 30. React Router

```jsx
<Route path="/user/:id" element={<User />} />
const { id } = useParams();
```

---

## 31. Dynamic Routing

```jsx
<Route path="/product/:productId" element={<Product />} />
```

---

## 32. Testing React Components

* Jest + React Testing Library
* E2E: Cypress/Playwright

---

## 33. Event Handling

```jsx
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>
```

React uses `SyntheticEvent`.

Common Synthetic Event Methods and Properties
event.preventDefault():
Prevents the default action associated with the event (e.g., preventing form submission, link navigation).
event.stopPropagation():
Prevents the event from bubbling up to parent elements (stops the event from propagating).
event.target:
The DOM element that triggered the event (similar to the native event.target).
event.currentTarget:
The DOM element that the event handler is currently attached to (this is useful in event delegation).
event.type:
The type of the event (e.g., click, submit, change).
event.persist():
Call this method to remove an event from the React event pool. This allows you to access the event properties asynchronously,
 for example, after a setTimeout or when handling a promise.
Types of Events in React:
React’s synthetic event system works with various types of events, such as:

Mouse Events: onClick, onDoubleClick, onMouseEnter, onMouseLeave, etc.
Keyboard Events: onKeyDown, onKeyUp, onKeyPress, etc.
Form Events: onChange, onSubmit, onFocus, onBlur, etc.
Focus Events: onFocus, onBlur, etc.
Touch Events: onTouchStart, onTouchMove, onTouchEnd, etc.
Clipboard Events: onCopy, onPaste, etc.
Media Events: onPlay, onPause, onVolumeChange, etc.

---

## 34. Performance Optimization

* React.memo, useMemo
* Avoid anonymous functions
* Virtualize large lists

---

## 35. Reconciliation
It is a recursion algorithm
The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.(Actual tree & browser tree)

**Answer:** Diffing old and new VDOM trees to apply minimal DOM updates.

---

## 36. Component Lifecycle

* Mount: useEffect(\[])
* Update: useEffect(\[dep])
* Unmount: return cleanup in useEffect

---

## 37. Fetch Data on Mount

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('/api').then(res => res.json()).then(setData);
}, []);
```

---

## 38. Class vs Function Components

**Use Class:** Error boundaries, legacy code.

---

## 39. HOCs vs Render Props

```jsx
// HOC
function withAuth(Component) {
  return function Wrapped(props) {
    return <Component {...props} />;
  };
}

// Render Props
<DataFetcher render={(data) => <Chart data={data} />} />
```

---

## 40. Lifting State Up

Lifting state up means moving shared state to the closest common ancestor of the components that need access to it

**Example:** Form input shared across siblings.
Use Case
Form with multiple fields (name, email) → parent tracks all input.

Filters (checkboxes, sliders) affecting a common product list.

Tabs or toggle buttons that need to update shared display.
// 
function Parent() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');

  return (
    <>
      <Input value={value} onChange={setValue} label="A" />
      <Input value={value} onChange={setValue} label="B" />
    </>
  );
}

function Input({ value, onChange, label }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <label>{label}</label>
      <input value={value} onChange={e => onChange(e.target.value)} />
    </div>
  );
}

---

## 41. React.memo

React.memo is a higher-order component used to optimize performance by memoizing functional components — i.e., it prevents unnecessary re-renders when the component’s props haven’t changed.
```jsx
const MemoComponent = React.memo(MyComponent);

Avoid re-rendering functional components if their props stay the same.

Similar to shouldComponentUpdate in class components.
```

---

## 42. Window Resize Event

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const handleResize = () => setWidth(window.innerWidth);
  window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
}, []);
```

---

## 43. Securing React Apps

* Avoid XSS(Cross-Site Scripting)
* Use HTTPS
* Store tokens securely

---

## 44. Third-party Libraries

**Example:** Using `react-chartjs-2`

```jsx
<Bar data={data} options={options} />
```

---

## 45. useEffect Pitfalls

* Missing dependencies
* Infinite loops
* Avoid side-effects in render

---

## 46. Authentication

* JWT in cookies
* `PrivateRoute` for protected pages
* Auth Context

---

## 47. Accessibility (a11y)

* Semantic HTML
* ARIA roles
* Keyboard support

---

## 48. Environment Variables

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.example.com
```

Access via `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL`

---

## 49. Deployment Strategies

* Static: Vercel, Netlify
* SSR: Next.js
* Traditional hosting: CRA + Express

---

## 50. Debugging Tools

* React DevTools
* Profiler
* Breakpoints
* ESLint rules

# Advanced React Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. What are the limitations of React in building large-scale applications?

* Boilerplate for state management
* SEO in SPAs (unless SSR is used)
* Requires third-party libraries for routing, data fetching, etc.
* Complex debugging in large trees

**Use Case in Projects:**
When building a CMS or e-commerce platform with multiple features, using React alone would need Redux for state, React Router for navigation, and SSR with Next.js for SEO.

## 2. How does React manage the Virtual DOM, and what are the benefits?

React creates a virtual copy of the DOM and updates only the differences using a diffing algorithm.
**Benefits:**

* Efficient rendering
* Improves performance
* Reduces real DOM manipulations

**Use Case in Projects:**
In a dashboard with frequent state updates (e.g., live analytics), Virtual DOM ensures only changed charts or values update without full page rerenders.

## 3. Can React Hooks fully replace Redux for state management?

**No**, not always.

* Hooks work well for local state.
* Redux suits complex global state, middleware, time-travel debugging.

**Use Case in Projects:**
For small projects like a todo app, Hooks are sufficient. For large apps with user sessions, notifications, and permissions, Redux is better.

## 4. Best practices for managing state in large React applications

* Local: `useState`, `useReducer`
* Global: Context API, Redux, Zustand
* Normalize state
* Avoid deeply nested state

**Use Case in Projects:**
In an ERP system, use Redux for shared data like user profiles and permissions, and `useReducer` for forms and modals.

## 5. Optimize performance in a React app with large component trees

* Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`
* Code splitting
* Virtualize long lists (`react-window`)
* Lazy loading

**Use Case in Projects:**
In a CRM showing thousands of contacts, use `react-window` to render visible rows only and `React.memo` to skip rerendering unchanged contact cards.

## 6. Explain React's Strict Mode and its impact on development

`<React.StrictMode>` highlights unsafe lifecycles, side-effects and legacy APIs in dev mode only.
It double-invokes render-related lifecycle methods.

**Use Case in Projects:**
Used in development to warn developers of potential issues before deploying an app like a finance dashboard into production.

## 7. Prevent unnecessary re-renders in React functional components

* Memoize components with `React.memo`
* Use `useCallback` for functions
* Use `useMemo` for values
* Avoid inline functions/objects in JSX

**Use Case in Projects:**
In a stock market app where frequent updates happen, memoize chart components to avoid rerendering unless their data actually changes.

## 8. Key differences: Functional vs Class components

| Feature   | Class Component   | Functional Component |
| --------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Syntax    | ES6 class         | JavaScript function  |
| State     | `this.state`      | `useState()`         |
| Lifecycle | lifecycle methods | `useEffect()`        |

**Use Case in Projects:**
Prefer functional components in new projects like blogging platforms for cleaner, concise code with Hooks support.

## 9. Significance of React Fiber architecture

* Improves responsiveness
* Enables interruption and prioritization
* Prepares React for concurrent rendering

**Use Case in Projects:**
Useful in apps with animations, like portfolio websites, where React can pause rendering and prioritize user interactions.

## 10. React side effects and how to manage them

Handled using `useEffect()`

```js
useEffect(() => {
 fetchData();
 return () => cleanup();
}, [dependencies]);
```

**Use Case in Projects:**
In a job portal app, use `useEffect` to fetch job listings when filters change.

## 11. `useMemo()` vs `useCallback()` in React

* `useMemo`: Caches computed values.
* `useCallback`: Caches function references.

**Use Case in Projects:**
Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations (e.g., filtering large data) and `useCallback` for event handlers in a form builder app.

## 12. Dynamic form handling and validation

Use `useState` for fields and libraries like Formik or React Hook Form for validation.

**Use Case in Projects:**
In a user onboarding form with dynamic fields, use Formik for schema validation and conditional rendering.

## 13. Lazy loading in React

Implemented with `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`.

```js
const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./HeavyComponent'));
```

**Use Case in Projects:**
In a dashboard, load heavy charts only when their tab is opened.

## 14. Handling errors and error boundaries

Use error boundaries via class components.

```js
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  componentDidCatch(error, info) {}
  render() { return this.props.children; }
}
```

**Use Case in Projects:**
Catch rendering errors in third-party widgets or charts.

## 15. Benefits of server-side rendering (SSR)

* Faster initial load
* Better SEO
* Improved performance on slow networks

**Use Case in Projects:**
In a news portal, use SSR with Next.js to serve content for crawlers and improve load time.

## 16. Styling in React components

* CSS Modules
* Styled Components
* Tailwind CSS

**Use Case in Projects:**
Use Tailwind in modern UIs (e.g., admin panel) for utility-first styling and faster dev time.

## 17. Pass data between sibling components without Redux

Lift state up to their common parent.

**Use Case in Projects:**
In a quiz app, share selected answers between question and summary components.

## 18. `useEffect()` for fetching API data

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    const res = await fetch('/api/data');
    setData(await res.json());
  };
  fetchData();
}, []);
```

**Use Case in Projects:**
Fetch blog posts or comments on component mount.

## 19. Handle async operations using `async/await` or Promises

Use `useEffect` or callbacks with async logic.

**Use Case in Projects:**
In a movie app, use async API calls to load details after user clicks a movie title.

## 20. Re-render on window resize

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const handleResize = () => setSize(window.innerWidth);
  window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
}, []);
```

**Use Case in Projects:**
In a responsive layout, update grid or chart width on resize.

## 21. React Context API for state management

Create a context and use `useContext` to share state.

**Use Case in Projects:**
Share theme settings or language preferences across the app.

## 22. React Router and dynamic routing

```js
<Route path="/product/:id" component={ProductPage} />
```

**Use Case in Projects:**
For an e-commerce store with dynamic product pages.

## 23. Controlled vs Uncontrolled components

* Controlled: State managed by React
* Uncontrolled: DOM manages input state

**Use Case in Projects:**
Use controlled inputs in forms where validation is needed; uncontrolled for simple file uploads.

## 24. Optimize performance with large lists/grids

Use `react-window` or `react-virtualized`.

**Use Case in Projects:**
In an email client or messaging app rendering thousands of items.

## 25. Shallow vs deep comparison in `shouldComponentUpdate`

* Shallow: checks reference equality
* Deep: checks nested values

**Use Case in Projects:**
Optimize rendering in performance-critical components like charts or maps.

## 26. Handle async code and state updates

Avoid setting state after unmount, cancel pending requests.

**Use Case in Projects:**
In a profile settings page, prevent updating state after the user navigates away.

## 27. Custom hooks to abstract logic

```js
function useAuth() {
 const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
 useEffect(() => fetchUser(), []);
 return user;
}
```

**Use Case in Projects:**
Share login state logic across multiple pages.

## 28. Higher-order components (HOCs)

Functions that take and return components.

**Use Case in Projects:**
Wrap analytics or auth check logic in reusable HOCs.

## 29. Search with debouncing

```js
const debounce = (fn, delay) => {
 let timer;
 return (...args) => {
   clearTimeout(timer);
   timer = setTimeout(() => fn(...args), delay);
 };
};
```

**Use Case in Projects:**
Prevent API spam while searching contacts or products.

## 30. React reconciliation and DOM update

React compares Virtual DOM trees and applies minimal real DOM changes.

**Use Case in Projects:**
In a kanban board, moving cards updates only affected columns efficiently.

# Error Boundary? (use only class comp)
React provides lifecycle methods (componentDidCatch and getDerivedStateFromError) for class components to implement error boundaries.
