# HTTP
 Transfer protocol for  transforming  data over the web .
 Its operate over port 80
 Data transmited over HTTP is not encrypted

 # HTTPS 
  Secure version of HTTP that uses encreption to protect  during transmition 
  Its operate over port 443
  HTTP encrypts data using SSL(Secure Socket layer ) and TSL (Transport layer security)

  Encryption (2 types )- 
    1. Symetric key - enc & dec both are use in same key
        Faster and more effiecent ,suitable for large data & challenging for distribution 
    2. Asymentric key - 
        Slower ,suitable for small data  & simplifeid key distribution, secure even if publi key is secure. 
       a).Pub -  Only enc
       b).Private - Only Dec 
    3. Hybrid Encreption 
# How to work SSL
  signature = server pub_key + authority pub_key(Certifiacte authority)
  Send the certificate  to client for verify then encrypt data
 
# Status code -
  1st line of response, Indicating the result of request, Divide into 5 Group.
  # 1XX -Informational code 
    100 - Continue
     Continue the connection for receiving  complete message body using request.
  # 2xx - Request was successful 
    200- Ok

        Redirect to differnet URL, using Location header (Use New Url).
    302- Found 
         same the above but (Revert to the  Original URL in subsequent request )
    304 - Not modifed 
         Instruct the browser  to use its cached copy of the request resource.(If modify-since & If none match)
    
  # 4xx - The Request conatined an error of some kind

# Virtual DoM
Virtual Dom is nothing but copy of real DOM 
Create a new Dom then change 
Behind the sence react use fiber algorithm.
While using the diiffing algo then patch changes to update on real dom ,
(Once in React known somthing has changes then react update those and only those object on the real dom)
DOM SAYS- I have no idea what changed so i will rerender everything and see's what diffrent now .

# Reconciliation
It is a recursion algorithm
The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.(Actual tree & browser tree)
# Shadow Dom 
 Shadow DOM let us  create a custom components or in others word create a scope DOM tree inside  our element.
 like video tag

# which one better React or Angular.
# React -
  ✅ Advantages:
     Flexibility- you want using additional libraries (e.g., Redux, React Router).
     Component-Based: React’s reusable components make UI development fast and organized.
     Performance: Efficient virtual DOM and faster re-rendering.
  Limitations - 
     Too much freedom: It doesn’t provide a fixed project structure, which can lead to inconsistencies across teams if not carefully managed.
     Boilerplate with state management: Complex state (Redux or context) often increases code and learning overhead.
     SEO (before Next.js): React SPAs initially had poor SEO capabilities unless SSR (like Next.js) was used.


# Angular - 
   Complete Framework: Comes with everything built-in – routing, HTTP client, forms, validation, dependency injection, etc.
   TypeScript by default: Type safety, auto-complete, and tooling support are great for large-scale enterprise applications.
   Strong Architecture: Enforces structure (MVC), scalable codebase, and clean separation of concerns.
   Tooling: Angular CLI is extremely powerful for scaffolding, testing, and building apps.
   Two-Way Data Binding: Useful in form-heavy or real-time data applications.
   
   Limitations:
    Steeper Learning Curve: Concepts like decorators, RxJS (observables), modules, and dependency injection take time to master.
    Verbose Code: More boilerplate compared to React; development feels heavy for small projects.
    Performance (in large DOMs): Might need optimization for change detection in large apps.

# Promises- 





    | Method                 | Kaam kya karta hai (Hinglish)                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Promise.all()`        | Sabhi promises complete ho to result dega, ek bhi fail ho to reject karega |
| `Promise.allSettled()` | Sabhi ka result dega, chahe success ya fail                                |
| `Promise.race()`       | Jo sabse pehle complete ho (success/fail), wahi return hoga                |
| `Promise.any()`        | Jo pehla success ho, wahi return; sab fail ho to error                     |
| `Promise.resolve()`    | Ek resolved promise banata hai kisi value se                               |
| `Promise.reject()`     | Ek rejected promise return karta hai  
                                     |

🔹 1. Promise.all()
Definition:
Promise.all() ek method hai jo multiple promises ko ek sath run karta hai aur tabhi resolve hota hai jab sabhi promises successfully complete ho jayein. Agar ek bhi promise reject ho gaya to ye pura reject ho jata hai.

// const p1 = Promise.resolve(10);
// const p2 = Promise.resolve(20);
// const p3 = Promise.resolve(30);

// Promise.all([p1, p2, p3])
//   .then(result => {
//     console.log(result,'All'); // [10, 20, 30]
// });

🔹 2. Promise.allSettled()
Definition:
Promise.allSettled() method sabhi promises ke result ka wait karta hai, chahe wo resolve ho ya reject. Ye hamesha array return karta hai jisme har promise ka status (fulfilled ya rejected) aur uska value ya reason hota hai.
  
// const p1 = Promise.resolve("Success");
// const p2 = Promise.reject("Failed");

// Promise.allSettled([p1, p2]).then(results => {
//   console.log(results);
// });

🔹 3. Promise.race()
Definition:
Promise.race() un promises me se jo pehle complete hota hai (resolve ya reject), usi ka result return karta hai. Baaki promises ko ignore kar deta hai.

// const p1 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve("First"), 200));
// const p2 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve("Second"), 100));

// Promise.race([p1, p2]).then(result => {
//   console.log(result); // "First"
// });

🔹 4. Promise.any()
Definition:
Promise.any() un sabhi promises me se jo pehla successfully resolve hota hai, usi ka result return karta hai. Agar sabhi promises reject ho jayein, to ye AggregateError deta hai.

// const p1 = Promise.reject("Error1");
// const p2 = Promise.resolve("Success");
// const p3 = Promise.reject("Error3");

// Promise.any([p1, p2, p3]).then(result => {
//   console.log(result); // "Success"
// });


🔹 5. Promise.resolve()
Definition:
Promise.resolve() kisi bhi value ko ek resolved promise me convert karta hai. Iska use synchronous value ko promise ke form me wrap karne ke liye hota hai.

// const p = Promise.resolve("Resolved value");
// p.then(res => console.log(res)); // "Resolved value"

🔹 6. Promise.reject()
Definition:
Promise.reject() kisi bhi reason ke saath ek rejected promise create karta hai. Ye mostly error handle karne ke use cases me use hota hai.


// const p = Promise.reject("Something went wrong");
// p.catch(err => console.log(err)); // "Something went wrong"



# Shallowcopy deepcopy
```jsx
let arr = [1,2,[3,4]]
// let copyArr = arr
// let copyArr = [...arr]; //shasllow coppy
let copyArr = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(arr)) // deep coppy
// copyArr.push(5); 
copyArr[2].push(5)
console.log(arr,'main Arr');
console.log(copyArr,'copy Arr')

```



# var, let, const in JavaScript - 
-> Declare variables in JavaScript

    Function-scoped (NOT block-scoped).
    Hoisted with initialization to undefined.
    Can be redeclared and updated.
# Var 
  # Hoisting with var
    console.log(a); // undefined
    var a = 10;
  #  Function Scope
  function test() {
    if (true) {
      var x = 100;
    }
    console.log(x); // ✅ 100
  }
  test(); 
  # Redeclaration Allowed
  var a = 10;
  var a = 20; // ✅ Allowed
  console.log(a); // 20

# Let
      Block-scoped.
      Hoisted but not initialized → leads to Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).
      Can be updated but not redeclared in the same scope.
    
  # Block Scope

      if (true) {
      let x = 10;
    }
    console.log(x); // ❌ ReferenceError
  # No Redeclaration
    let a = 5;
    let a = 10; // ❌ SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared

  # TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone)
    console.log(a); // ❌ ReferenceError
    let a = 10;

# Const
 
    Block-scoped like let.
    Hoisted but not initialized (TDZ applies).
    Cannot be reassigned or redeclared.
    For objects and arrays, values can be mutated (but reference cannot change).
  # Cannot Reassign
   const a = 10;
   a = 20; // ❌ TypeError: Assignment to constant variable

  # Object Mutation is Allowed
    const user = { name: "Shantilal" };
    user.name = "Kachhawa"; // ✅ Allowed
    console.log(user.name); // Kachhawa
  # Array Mutation
    const arr = [1, 2, 3];
    arr.push(4); // ✅ Allowed
    console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4]


  # No Redeclaration
   const a = 10;
   const a = 20; // ❌ SyntaxError


🔹 1. What is a Mono-repo?
✅ Definition:
A Mono-repo (monolithic repository) is a single code repository that contains multiple projects or packages (e.g., frontend, backend, shared libraries) — all living together in the same Git repository.


🔹 2. What is a Multi-repo?
✅ Definition:
In a Multi-repo setup, each service, project, or package lives in its own separate Git repository.

🧪 Example (Node.js Project):
You have separate repos like:
frontend-app/ → React/Next.js
backend-api/ → Node.js API
shared-utils/ → NPM package used by both


# What is socket.io?
✅ Definition:
Socket.IO is a JavaScript library built on top of WebSockets (but not limited to them).
It provides an event-based API and fallback support (like long polling) to ensure real-time communication even if WebSocket is not supported.

📌 Think of Socket.IO as:

"WebSocket + reconnect + fallback + rooms + broadcasting + easy events"
Socket communication is often built using WebSockets protocol.


# Common Events in socket.io
| Event        | Description                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `connection` | When a client connects            |
| `disconnect` | When a client disconnects         |
| `emit()`     | To send data                      |
| `on()`       | To receive/listen to events       |
| `broadcast`  | Send message to all except sender |






#  How Socket Works (Step by Step)
1. Client connects to server via socket
2. Server listens for connections
3. Both can emit and listen to messages continuously
4. Connection stays open until manually closed or disconnected
📌 Unlike HTTP, socket doesn't need to request-response each time.


#  What is WebSocket?
✅ Definition:
WebSocket is a protocol (like HTTP or FTP) that enables full-duplex, two-way communication between the client and the server over a single, persistent connection.

📌 Example Use Case:
Chat, games, stock tickers, real-time updates.

const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3000');
ws.send("Hello Server!");


Q: What's the difference between WebSocket and socket.io?
A: WebSocket is the protocol. socket.io is a library that uses WebSocket under the hood, and provides:
  Reconnection
  Fallbacks
  Rooms/namespaces
  Events API


## How does useEffect() work? Use cases?

**Answer:** Runs side effects after rendering.

**Example:**

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, []);

import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export default function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Effect 1 - No deps");
    return () => console.log("Cleanup 1");
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Effect 2 - With deps", count);
    return () => console.log("Cleanup 2");
  }, [count]);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Effect 3 - Empty deps");
    return () => console.log("Cleanup 3");
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
// Output on first render:
// Effect 1 - No deps
// Effect 2 - With deps 0
// Effect 3 - Empty deps
// Output on button click (state change):
// Cleanup 1
// Effect 1 - No deps
// Cleanup 2
// Effect 2 - With deps 1

```

**Use Cases:** Fetching data, subscriptions, DOM updates.

##  What is React.memo?
✅ Definition:
React.memo is a Higher-Order Component (HOC) used to memoize a React component — it prevents unnecessary re-rendering if the props haven't changed.

📌 Use case: Optimizing functional components that receive the same props but still re-render due to parent re-rendering.
```jsx

const Child = React.memo(({ name }) => {
  console.log("Child rendered");
  return <p>Hello, {name}</p>;
});

function Parent() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <Child name="Shantilal" />
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
##  2. What is useMemo?
✅ Definition:
useMemo is a React Hook that memoizes the result of a function — used to avoid expensive calculations unless dependencies change.

📌 Use case: Optimizing heavy functions or computed values during rendering.

```jsx
function ExpensiveComponent({ num }) {
  const expensiveValue = React.useMemo(() => {
    console.log("Calculating...");
    let result = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < 1e9; i++) {
      result += i;
    }
    return result + num;
  }, [num]);

  return <p>Expensive result: {expensiveValue}</p>;
}


```

| Feature       | `React.memo`                          | `useMemo`                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Type          | Higher-Order Component (HOC)          | React Hook                                   |
| Purpose       | Memoize entire **component**          | Memoize **calculated value**                 |
| Prevents      | Unnecessary **component re-renders**  | Unnecessary **function re-executions**       |
| Dependencies  | **Props** of the component            | **Dependency array** inside `useMemo`        |
| Use Case      | Functional components receiving props | Expensive computations (maps, filters, etc.) |
| React version | React 16.6+                           | React 16.8+                                  |


##  What is useCallback?
✅ Definition:
useCallback is a React Hook that memoizes a function — it returns the same function instance unless its dependencies change.

📌 Hinglish Explanation:
Agar aap ek function ko baar-baar render ke time redefine kar rahe ho, aur wo function child component ko as prop pass ho raha ho — to unnecessary re-render hote hain.
useCallback isko rokta hai by giving you same function reference unless dependencies change.


```jsx
function Parent() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  const handleClick = React.useCallback(() => {
    console.log("Clicked");
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <Child onClick={handleClick} />
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

```
| Feature              | `useMemo`                      | `useCallback`                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Memoizes             | **Return value** of a function | **Function itself** (its reference) |
| Returns              | Cached **value**               | Cached **function**                 |
| Use Case             | Expensive calculation          | Passing stable function to children |
| Returns same object? | Only value                     | ✅ Same function reference           |


## What is Debounce?
✅ Definition:
Debouncing means:
“Wait until the user stops triggering an event, then execute the function after a delay.”

📌 Hinglish Explanation:

Jab user baar-baar koi event trigger kare (jaise typing), to function tab tak nahi chalega jab tak user ruk na jaye. Jaise hi user rukta hai, function ek delay ke baad run hota hai.


## What is Throttle?
✅ Definition:
Throttling means:
“Execute the function at regular intervals, no matter how many times the event is triggered.”

📌 Hinglish Explanation:

Agar user baar-baar koi event trigger kare, to function sirf fixed time gap ke baad hi chalega.


| Feature          | Debounce                             | Throttle                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Behavior         | Waits for silence, then fires        | Fires at regular intervals               |
| When runs        | After **user stops** triggering      | While **user is still** triggering       |
| Common use cases | Search inputs, text fields, autosave | Scroll, resize, mouse movement           |
| Example timing   | Run **after 300ms** of no typing     | Run **once every 300ms** regardless      |
| Calls frequency  | **Only once** after burst            | **Many times**, but at limited frequency |



| Task                    | Use This   |
| ----------------------- | ---------- |
| Search box              | `debounce` |
| Scroll animation/effect | `throttle` |
| Form autosave           | `debounce` |
| Drag and move UI        | `throttle` |
| Resize event            | `throttle` |
